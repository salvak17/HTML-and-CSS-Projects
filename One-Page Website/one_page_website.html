				<h2>Let's hold the US Army accountable.</h2>
				<details>
					<summary>What happened at Fort Hood?</summary>
					<p>Fort Hood is a US Army post located in Killeen, Texas. It is the site of Vanessa Guillen's death, 
					where she was bludgeoned to death with a hammer in the armory room where she worked. Her body was then 
					transported from the military installation and taken to be burned and butchered to get rid of her body. 
					Her murder was the day before she was to report sexual harassment, when the killer found out she was 
					going to come forward, he murdered her with a hammer, and had other accomplices. An investigation was 
					not opened soon enough, and only started going after Vanessa's mother and family went to social media 
					to demand they find her daughter as she was missing since April. A petition to hold the US Army 
					accountable to fail to keep their own safe and failed to find justice is under way. Vanessa is not the 
					first victim at Fort Hood and her body was found days after Gregory Wedel-Morales, who was found 
					missing LAST YEAR while driving in Killeen. There have been more disappearances from Fort Hood within 
					the past year. These men and women vowed to keep our country safe, it is time the US Army help their 
					soldiers stay safe. Vanessa was only 20 years old. Sign the petition on Change.org.
